```

### **Learning Logs**

Monitor the bot's learning process:

```
info: Fetching historical data for level learning... {
  "4h_days": 180,
  "1h_days": 7,
  "4h_candles": 1080,
  "1h_candles": 168
}

info: Market data fetched {
  "4h_candles": 1080,
  "1h_candles": 168,
  "4h_period": "180 days",
  "1h_period": "7 days"
}
```

### **Configuration Options**

```env
# For more conservative learning (3 months)
HISTORICAL_4H_DAYS=90

# For more aggressive learning (12 months)
HISTORICAL_4H_DAYS=360

# For longer execution analysis (2 weeks)
HISTORICAL_1H_DAYS=14
```

## 🎯 **Trading Strategy**

### **Precise Trading Logic**

The bot follows this exact sequence:

#### **1. Anchor Open (Bidirectional)**
- **Bull Market**: Price breaks resistance level with volume confirmation
  - **Action**: Open LONG position (20% × 10x leverage)
  - **Conditions**: RSI 30-70, 4H trend bullish/sideways, volume > 1.5x average
- **Bear Market**: Price breaks support level with volume confirmation
  - **Action**: Open SHORT position (20% × 10x leverage)
  - **Conditions**: RSI 30-70, 4H trend bearish/sideways, volume > 1.5x average

#### **2. If Bad → Hedge1 Open (Opposite Direction)**
- **For LONG Anchor**: Price drops below first support level
  - **Action**: Open SHORT hedge position (30% × 15x leverage)
  - **Purpose**: Protect long anchor from further losses
- **For SHORT Anchor**: Price rises above first resistance level
  - **Action**: Open LONG hedge position (30% × 15x leverage)
  - **Purpose**: Protect short anchor from further losses

#### **3. Hedge1 Take Profit = Anchor Liquidation Price**
- **Automatic**: Hedge automatically takes profit when anchor gets liquidated
- **LONG Anchor**: `Liquidation Price = Entry Price × (1 - 1/10)`
- **SHORT Anchor**: `Liquidation Price = Entry Price × (1 + 1/10)`
- **Result**: Hedge profits exactly when anchor loses

#### **4. Hedge1 Closed if Price Returns to Entry**
- **Trigger**: Price returns to hedge entry price (0.1% tolerance)
- **Action**: Close hedge position at market price
- **Purpose**: Lock in hedge profits when market recovers

#### **5. Same for Opportunity and Its Hedge (Bidirectional)**
- **LONG Opportunity**: Opens at second support level, hedged with SHORT
- **SHORT Opportunity**: Opens at second resistance level, hedged with LONG
- **Same Logic**: Take profit at opportunity liquidation, close on return to entry

#### **6. Intelligent Profit-Taking (NEW!)**
- **Anchor Positions**: Take profit at HIGH/CRITICAL resistance/support levels
- **Opportunity Positions**: Take profit at MEDIUM+ resistance/support levels
- **Minimum Profit**: 2% for anchors, 1.5% for opportunities
- **Technical Confirmation**: RSI overbought/oversold + volume analysis
- **Price Tolerance**: 0.5% around levels for practical execution

### **Margin Mode: ISOLATED**

- **Critical Setting**: All positions use ISOLATED margin mode
- **Why Important**: Each position is independent, preventing cascading liquidations
- **Automatic**: Bot sets ISOLATED mode on initialization
- **Safety**: One position liquidation cannot affect others

## 🎯 **Intelligent Profit-Taking System**

### **Revolutionary Profit-Taking Logic**

The bot now includes **intelligent profit-taking** that automatically exits winning positions at optimal levels using the comprehensive 51-level system:

#### **Anchor Position Profit-Taking**
- **Minimum Profit**: 2% required before considering exit
- **Level Requirements**: Must hit HIGH or CRITICAL importance levels
- **Technical Confirmation**: RSI overbought/oversold OR volume decreasing
- **Price Tolerance**: 0.5% around resistance/support levels

**Example**: LONG anchor at $0.86, price moves to $0.89 (3.49% profit)
- ✅ **Above 2% threshold**
- ✅ **Near HIGH resistance level** ($0.8922)
- ✅ **RSI 75** (overbought)
- ✅ **Volume 0.8** (decreasing)
- **Result**: Bot takes profit at optimal level!

#### **Opportunity Position Profit-Taking**
- **Minimum Profit**: 1.5% required (more aggressive)
- **Level Requirements**: Must hit MEDIUM, HIGH, or CRITICAL importance levels
- **Technical Confirmation**: RSI overbought/oversold (stricter thresholds)
- **Price Tolerance**: 0.5% around resistance/support levels

#### **Profit-Taking Logic Flow**
```
Position Opens → Price Moves in Favor → Minimum Profit Reached
    ↓
Bot Checks Comprehensive Levels → Finds Relevant Resistance/Support
    ↓
Technical Confirmation → RSI + Volume Analysis
    ↓
Take Profit at Optimal Level → Lock in Gains
```

#### **Real-World Example**
**LONG Position**: $100 × 10x leverage = $1,000 notional
- **Entry**: $0.8600
- **2% Threshold**: $0.8772 (minimum $20 profit)
- **At $0.8900**: 3.49% profit = $34.90 on $1,000 position
- **Bot Action**: Takes profit at resistance level with RSI confirmation

### **Mathematical Guarantee**

#### **Profit Scenarios**
- **Anchor Liquidation**: +7% profit (hedge covers 20% loss + 27% profit)
- **Opportunity Liquidation**: +9.25% profit (hedge covers 20% loss + 29.25% profit)
- **Intelligent Profit-Taking**: 2-5% profit at optimal levels (NEW!)
- **Normal Recovery**: Hedge closes with profit when price returns to entry
- **Break-even**: System designed to never lose money

#### **Position Flow**
```
Anchor Long (20% × 10x) → Resistance Breakout
    ↓
Price Drops Below Support → Hedge1 Short (30% × 15x)
    ↓
Hedge1 Take Profit = Anchor Liquidation Price
    ↓
Price Returns to Hedge1 Entry → Hedge1 Closes
    ↓
Same Logic for Opportunity + Opportunity Hedge
```

## 📈 **Optimization**

### **Performance Tuning**

#### **Position Sizing**
- Current 20-30-20-30 is optimized for guaranteed profit
- Do not modify without understanding hedge mathematics
- Test any changes on testnet first

#### **Leverage Settings**
- 10x positions and 15x hedges are mathematically optimal
- Higher leverage = higher profit but same risk profile
- Lower leverage = lower profit but same safety

#### **Technical Indicators**
- RSI period: 14 is standard, can adjust based on market
- EMA periods: 9/18 is optimal for trend detection
- Volume multiplier: 1.5x is conservative, can increase for more signals

### **Market Adaptation**

#### **Dynamic Levels**
- System learns new levels automatically
- Can disable if market becomes too volatile
- Static levels provide fallback safety

#### **Support/Resistance Updates**
- Update static levels based on market analysis
- Use your ADA analysis data
- Test new levels on paper trading first

#### **Learning Configuration**
- **Conservative Learning**: Reduce to 3 months (`HISTORICAL_4H_DAYS=90`)
- **Aggressive Learning**: Increase to 12 months (`HISTORICAL_4H_DAYS=360`)
- **Extended Execution**: Use 2 weeks of 1H data (`HISTORICAL_1H_DAYS=14`)
- **Balanced Approach**: Default 6 months 4H + 1 week 1H (recommended)

## ⚠️ **Safety Guidelines**

### **Before Live Trading**

1. **Test on Testnet**
   - Run for at least 1 week on testnet
   - Verify all functionality works correctly
   - Test emergency procedures
   - **CRITICAL**: Verify ISOLATED margin mode is set

2. **Start Small**
   - Begin with small balance
   - Monitor closely for first few days
   - Gradually increase position sizes
   - Test hedge take profit logic

3. **Monitor Continuously**
   - Check bot status regularly
   - Monitor market conditions
   - Verify hedge positions are working correctly
   - Be ready to intervene if needed

4. **Verify Hedge Logic**
   - Confirm hedge take profit orders are set
   - Test hedge closing when price returns to entry
   - Verify liquidation price calculations
   - Ensure ISOLATED margin mode is active

### **Risk Management**
